## About CutBox

CutBox keeps your pasteboard cut/copy history and lets you paste
anything back to your current app by searching for items.

Inspired by [JumpCut](https://github.com/snark/jumpcut) & [Flycut](https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut)

What does it do? Let's you search from your pasteboard history....

## Using CutBox

Any text you copy on MacOS is saved to CutBox's history.

CutBox Search is activated using a global hotkey:

<kbd>**Cmd**</kbd> + <kbd>**Shift**</kbd> + <kbd>**V**</kbd>

(This can be customized in preferences.)

### Searching and pasting

![](CutBox/CutBox/GraphicAssets/cutbox-search-fuzzy.png)

When you activate CutBox you can search for anything copied, just type
what you're searching for or navigate with the arrow keys (or
mouse/trackpad).

Press <kbd>**Enter**</kbd> and the selected item will paste into your
current app.

You can exit without pasting, just press <kbd>**Esc**</kbd>.

If fuzzy matching isn't specific enough for you, regexp matching is
also available.

Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> to toggle through search modes,
fuzzy match, regexp/i or regexp.
