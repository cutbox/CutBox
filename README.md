## About CutBox

CutBox keeps your pasteboard cut/copy history and lets you paste
anything back to your current app by fuzzy searching for items.

CutBox is inspired by [JumpCut](https://github.com/snark/jumpcut) & [Flycut](https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut)

## How to use CutBox

CutBox will be available from the Macos top menu and a global hotkey
combo **Cmd** + **Opt** + **Ctrl** + **V**

Start searching and paste the item you want to paste by pressing Enter
(currently just the top match, selecting other candidates coming
shortly)

To quit without pasting press **Esc** or click the mouse away from the
search popup.

# Development TODO
